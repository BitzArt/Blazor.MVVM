## Overview

This repository has been archived and is no longer maintained.

We have found that Blazor and the MVVM pattern don't go together as well as we had hoped, and we have decided to focus on a more general-purpose state management library for Blazor.

Work on state management functionality now continues in the [Blazor.State](https://github.com/BitzArt/Blazor.State) repository.
